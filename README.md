# World_Weather_Analysis

##
The purpose of this project is to ultimately create a vacation itinerary using google maps. I started by creating an initial database of random coordinates where they would be assigned to a city if they are within a certain radius. I then asked the user to provide their minimum and maximum temperatures for their vacation. The data is then filtered based on their input and the output is every city between the two temperatures. Next, the itinerary was created using the filtered data and 4 random cities. The itinerary consists of the route starting from one city, visiting 3 other cities, and returning back to the original city.
